Run the 'main_game.py' file, and don't mind the yellow errors, just due to me cutting corners while importing assets hehe

About the game:

I created this game in 12th with a friend of mine (he made all the assets n visuals).. Quite a fun project to work on, and now that I look back at it I realize how novice my coding style was, but it still got the job done lol
